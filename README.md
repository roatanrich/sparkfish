# Interview Questions

1. What are examples of the types of projects you have deployed to Azure? 
```diff
+ An Azure function written in Java deployed via GitHub action
+ An Azure web app written in .NET Core deployed via Octopus, then manually hot swapped via slots
```

2. How do you classify your senior-ness as a developer? What are your development strengths? 
```diff
+ I have many years writing code in the big two languages; C# and Java. I have held architect positions in both .NET and Java environments. When I approach a task, I don't just see the code, I mentally view how this piece of code fits in to the big picture and how this code can be tested.
```

3. What are your top 1-2 favorite editor(s)? 
```diff
+ Eclipse (Java) 
+ Visual Code (Node/Typescript, C#)
```

4. Have you ever done a pull request? 
```diff
+ I have done hundreds of pull requests
```

5. Have you ever had a chance to use TDD? Have you found it to be helpful? If so, when does it work best for you? 
```diff
+ I am a BDD Evangelist. As you might know, BDD is an evolution of TDD. One of the first things I ask when new code is brought in or discussed during a standup is "How will you test that?" I noticed in your exercise you referenced BDD with your Given/When/Then
```

6. Have you been given the opportunity to use tools like ReSharper? What did you like about it?
```diff
+ I am a Resharper baby, meaning I feel lost if I hop on a machine that doesn't have Resharper installed
```

7. Do you prefer working directly with the business people? Or do you find it's best to have a go-between?
```diff
+ I am very flexible and enjoy different environments, for example, one week I meet with customers then the next week I'm in the weeds with the devs
```

8. Have you ever used web.config transformations? If not, do you know what they are good for?
```diff
+ I have never used web.config for transformations so I had to Google and I see how that could be useful during deployments
```

9. Can you tell me anything about `slots` in terms of Azure? If not, based on what you just googled, how would you use them in your next Azure project?
```diff
+ Yes, the first question above I talk about using deploymnent slots in Azure. So we deployed to a slot, then perform a final smoke test on the slots, then we would perform a swap
```

10. Can you explain what DevOps and/or continuous integration is, and some of the benefits?
```diff
+ These days it seems CICD go together seemlessly, you dont have one without the other. My last position I handled the CICD for our team. This was a Java environment writing Azure Functions comitting to GitHub. The GitHub actions would fire off and handle the deployment to Azure. This encompassed a few things out of my perview, like KeyVaults and IP Assignement but writing bicep files for APIM access and Resource Group creation were just a few of the CICD tasks I was responsible for
```

11. Are you technology agnostic or are you pretty strict when it comes to things like Mac vs Windows, or AWS vs Azure?
```diff
+ I am a Windows guy but enjoy both AWS and Azure work. I prefer AWS because of its simplicity but have more experience in Azure
```

12. What are some of your more advanced SQL querying abilities (i.e., like what keywords or commands, etc)?
```diff
+ I am familiar with the basics of SQL Statements in addition to JOINs, inner and outer, these would be on the forefront of my mind. Anything more complex than that I would use ChatGPT or Google to help or if there is a DBA, I tend to keep things in a group as tribal knowledge can be key at times
```

13. Do you happen to know what TypeScript is and why it’s gotten popular? How does it differ from JS?
```diff
+ About 4 years ago I was getting bored with programming but luckily node.js came out and Typescript, once I learned those two items, programming was fun again. So, yes I am a huge fan of Typescript mainly due to its strongly typed capabilities
 ```

14. Can you explain the diff b/t relational databases and NoSQL? What are some NoSQL platforms that you have familiarity with?
```diff
+ Relational databases establish logical connections (i.e. relationships) between domain objects (ex: Customer -> Address) where NoSQL would just contain single documents (i.e. Tables) that store "blobs" of Customers and/or Addresses. My work in the past has been to use NoSQL for quick application access and eventually that NoSQL data would end up in a relational database after a batch process
```

15. Can you explain GPG, SSL or public/private key encryption?
```diff
+ I Googled GPG and see that it is a way to encrypt files, I have never used this. SSL deals with certificates, both Java and .NET web based programs would have an SSL certificate installed on a client computer and another practice it to install a certificate in a local Java keystore
```

16. Do you know anything about "secure coding" practices?
```diff
+ I have used tools like OWASP for penetration testing, then based on the report, went back and fixed the recommendations. I tend to remember what I changes and then make that fix part of my everyday coding practices
```

17. Can _you_ authenticate to GitHub using SSH?
```diff
+ Yes, we can connect to GitHub using SSH but this is something I have not done
```

18. Can you explain what REST sorta kinda means?
```diff
+ Rest is a way to expose access to ones backend domain via http. The protocols are GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE and PUT. One can reuse a Rest Api Uri by simply annotating the method in a controller with the respective Http Protocol. For example, the URI /listify, can exist for all protocols
```

19. How enthusiastic would you be if we asked to pay you to take some training courses on Udemy?
```diff
+ I am a huge advocate and consumer of both Udemy and Pluralsoft and would take any class you assign
```

20. How many of these platforms / languages / frameworks do you have experience with? 
```diff
+ Node, Typescript, React, SQL, Excel, Windows, Docker, Kubernetes (I'm lite on this), .NET, C#, NUnit, JUnit, Go (I took a UDemy class on Go), PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Azure, AWS
