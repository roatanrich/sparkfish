         *(1) If you don’t already have a free Azure dev account, go set that up now
         *(2) Set up a public repo on GitHub
         *(3) Create a WebAPI project that responds to GET requests on this endpoint route: /listify
         *(a) Accept begin / end range parameter values, in whatever way you think is most RESTful
         *(b) Accept a parameter to select the index within that range
         *(c) Return the value located in that index in whatever way you think is most RESTful
         *(4) Deploy this WebAPI endpoint into Azure
         *Once you have it deployed, share the working Azure link and GitHub repo link.
         *If you want bonus points, or just for fun, set up the GitHub webhook integration so that your endpoint
         *auto-deploys to Azure after each commit. :)
